# Introduction

my solutions for problems hosted at [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) aka social network for coding katas.
So far, I am having much fun solving them!

- The CLI client is great 
  - allows you to download a problem with the whole project structure
  - submitting your solution allows you to look up other people solutions and gain some insight how it would work as well
